# HKDD - HomeKit Dog Doorbell

This is a project I'm working on with the goal of creating an Apple HomeKit linked doorbell for my dog. I want to use an ESP32 board with a camera to send an image whenever the bell is pressed along with a notification that he is wanting to be let in. 

Stay tuned for updates as I progress!
